This theme overrides the default behavior in displaying hero images by adding the facility to display what is placed in the media **caption** field.

Captions should look like this (for <https://hbcudigitallibrary.auctr.edu/digital/collection/tuld/id/86/rec/4>):

```html

```

>>Be sure to include the `target="_blank"` attribute so a new tab is opened (since the user will be leaving the current site)
